- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nadi.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development , building my own awesome projects.
- I'm at the early stages of my web development career, eagerly soaking up knowledge and experience. My current focus lies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,React and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
-  I have been learning also backend development API,Database,Node.js, Express.js.I've built some awesome Web apps with backend tech such as Weather App, ToDoList with MongoDB Database and so on.
- I prefer backend techs in Web (Nodejs,expressjs, API, Database,Data structures & algrothms) , they are more interesting for me and My fav language is Python but I want to learn "Swift" cuz I wanna be a IOS developer.

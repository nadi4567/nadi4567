- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nadi.
- ðŸŒ±I'm  learning web development and building my own awesome projects through Angela Yu's Full Stack Web Development course on Udemy.
   My current focus lies in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,React and I'm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.
  
-  I have been learning also backend development API,Database,Node.js, Express.js.I've built some awesome Web apps with backend tech such as Weather App, ToDoList with MongoDB Database and so on.
-
-  I completed Professor David's CS50-X course, where I gained in-depth knowledge of computer science.The CS50 course was fascinating, covering various topics such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and C programming. However, we only received an introduction to these subjects, so I didn't get a deep dive into programming languages xdxd.
- I prefer backend techs in Web (Nodejs,expressjs, API, Database,Data structures & algorithm) , they are more interesting for me and My fav language is Python but I want to learn "Swift" cuz I wanna be a IOS developer.
